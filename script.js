    title: "📚 TYPES OF SETS",
    questions: [
      { question: "Which set contains a limited number of elements?", choices: ["Finite Set", "Infinite Set", "Empty Set"], answer: "Finite Set", hint: "Its number of elements can be counted.", explain: "A finite set has a countable number of elements, so you could list them all and reach an end. {1, 2, 3} is finite." },
      { question: "Which set has no elements?", choices: ["Singleton Set", "Empty Set", "Universal Set"], answer: "Empty Set", hint: "It is also called the null set.", explain: "The empty set, written ∅ or { }, has zero elements. A singleton has exactly one, and the universal set holds everything under discussion." },
      { question: "Which set contains exactly one element?", choices: ["Infinite Set", "Singleton Set", "Empty Set"], answer: "Singleton Set", hint: "Think of a set with just one member.", explain: "A singleton set has exactly one element, such as {7}. One member only, no more and no fewer." },
      { question: "Which set contains an unlimited number of elements?", choices: ["Finite Set", "Empty Set", "Infinite Set"], answer: "Infinite Set", hint: "Its elements never end.", explain: "An infinite set never runs out of elements. The natural numbers {1, 2, 3, …} keep going forever." },
      { question: "If A = {1, 2} and B = {1, 2}, what is their relationship?", choices: ["Equal Sets", "Disjoint Sets", "Empty Sets"], answer: "Equal Sets", hint: "Both sets have the exact same elements.", explain: "Sets are equal when they contain exactly the same elements. Order and repeats don’t matter, so {1, 2} and {2, 1} are equal." },
      { question: "If A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}, what are these sets?", choices: ["Equal Sets", "Disjoint Sets", "Overlapping Sets"], answer: "Disjoint Sets", hint: "They have no common elements.", explain: "Disjoint sets have no element in common, so their intersection is empty. {1, 2} and {3, 4} share nothing." },
      { question: "If A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3}, what type of sets are they?", choices: ["Disjoint Sets", "Overlapping Sets", "Empty Sets"], answer: "Overlapping Sets", hint: "They share one element.", explain: "Overlapping sets share at least one element but each also has elements the other lacks. Here 2 is shared, 1 is only in A and 3 is only in B." },
      { question: "If every element of A is also in B, what is A in relation to B?", choices: ["A subset of B", "A disjoint set", "An infinite set"], answer: "A subset of B", hint: "Use the subset relationship.", explain: "A is a subset of B when every element of A is also in B. That is what “A ⊆ B” says." },
      { question: "Which symbol means 'is an element of'?", choices: ["∈", "∪", "∩"], answer: "∈", hint: "This symbol indicates membership.", explain: "∈ reads “is an element of”, as in 2 ∈ {1, 2, 3}. ∪ means union and ∩ means intersection." },
      { question: "If A = {2, 4, 6}, is 4 an element of A?", choices: ["Yes", "No", "A is empty"], answer: "Yes", hint: "Check whether 4 appears in A.", explain: "Check membership by looking for 4 in the list. A = {2, 4, 6} contains 4, so 4 ∈ A." },
      { question: "Which symbol means 'is a subset of'?", choices: ["⊆", "∩", "∪"], answer: "⊆", hint: "It represents a subset.", explain: "⊆ reads “is a subset of”. ∪ is union and ∩ is intersection, which are operations rather than relationships." },
      { question: "If A = {1, 2} and B = {1, 2, 3}, is A a subset of B?", choices: ["Yes", "No", "They are disjoint"], answer: "Yes", hint: "Every element of A appears in B.", explain: "Both 1 and 2 appear in B = {1, 2, 3}, so every element of A is in B. That makes A a subset of B." },
      { question: "What is a proper subset?", choices: ["A subset that is not equal to the original set", "A set with no elements", "A set with infinite elements"], answer: "A subset that is not equal to the original set", hint: "It is a subset but not the same set.", explain: "A proper subset sits inside a set but is not equal to it, so the larger set has at least one extra element. {1} is a proper subset of {1, 2}." },
      { question: "What makes two finite sets equivalent?", choices: ["They have the same number of elements", "They have exactly the same elements", "They have no elements"], answer: "They have the same number of elements", hint: "Compare their cardinalities.", explain: "Equivalent sets have the same number of elements (the same cardinality), even if the elements differ. {1, 2} and {a, b} are equivalent but not equal." },
      { question: "What is the universal set?", choices: ["The set of all elements being considered", "A set with one element only", "A set with no elements"], answer: "The set of all elements being considered", hint: "It contains the elements under discussion.", explain: "The universal set U contains every element being considered in a problem. Other sets are subsets of it, and complements are taken relative to it." },
      { question: "Which symbol commonly represents the empty set?", choices: ["∅", "∪", "∈"], answer: "∅", hint: "It looks like a crossed-out circle.", explain: "The empty set is written ∅ (or { }). ∪ is union and ∈ is “is an element of”." },
      { question: "If A = {a, b, c}, how many elements are in A?", choices: ["2", "3", "4"], answer: "3", hint: "Count each different element.", explain: "Count each different element once. A = {a, b, c} has a, b and c, which makes 3." },
      { question: "If A = {1, 2, 3}, which statement is true?", choices: ["2 ∈ A", "5 ∈ A", "4 ∈ A"], answer: "2 ∈ A", hint: "Check which number belongs to A.", explain: "Membership means the number is listed in the set. A = {1, 2, 3} lists 2, but not 4 or 5." },
      { question: "If A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3}, which element do they share?", choices: ["1", "2", "3"], answer: "2", hint: "Find the common element.", explain: "Look for elements listed in both sets. A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3} both contain 2, while 1 and 3 each appear only once." }
